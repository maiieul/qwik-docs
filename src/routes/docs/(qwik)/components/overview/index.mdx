# Components

Components are the basic building blocks of Qwik Applications. Qwik components are unique in that:

- Qwik components automatically get broken down into lazy-loaded chunks by the [Optimizer](../../advanced/optimizer/index.mdx).
- They are [resumable](../../concepts/resumable/index.mdx) (a component can get created on a server and continue its execution on the client).
- They are [reactive](../../concepts/reactivity/index.mdx) and render independently of other components on the page. See [rendering](../../components/rendering/index.mdx).

## `component$()`

A component is a small, reusable piece of code that can be used to build a UI.

In Qwik, they are declared using the `component$` method:

```tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  return <span>Hello World!</span>;
});
```
<CodeSandbox src={SimpleComponent} sandboxStyle={{ height: '3em' }} />

> The reason for the `component$` is that the trailing `$` allows the [Optimizer](/docs/advanced/dollar/) to break the components into an application tree into a separate chunk so that each chunk can be loaded (or not loaded if it is not needed) independently. Without the `$` the component would be always loaded if the parent component needs to be loaded.

### Composing Components

Components can be composed together to create more complex components.

```tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <>
      <div>Parent Text</div>
      <Child />
    </>
  );
});

const Child = component$(() => {
  return <div>Child Text</div>;
});
```
<CodeSandbox src={TwoComponents} sandboxStyle={{ height: '6em' }} />

### Counter Example

A slightly more complex example of a counter.

```tsx
import { component$, useSignal } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  const count = useSignal(0);

  return (
    <>
      <div>Count: {count.value}</div>
      <button onClick$={(e) => count.value++}>Increment</button>
    </>
  );
});
```
<CodeSandbox src={Counter} sandboxStyle={{ height: '6em' }} />

## Props

Props are used to pass data into the component. Props are declared as named arguments of the component.

In this example a component `Item` declares optional `name`, `quantity`, `description`, and `price`.

```tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Props</h1>
      <Item name="hammer" price={9.99} />
    </>
  );
});

interface ItemProps {
  name?: string;
  quantity?: number;
  description?: string;
  price?: number;
}

export const Item = component$<ItemProps>(({ name, quantity, description, price }) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      <li>name: {name}</li>
      <li>quantity: {quantity}</li>
      <li>description: {description}</li>
      <li>price: {price}</li>
    </ul>
  );
});
```
<CodeSandbox src={Props} sandboxStyle={{ height: '10em' }} />

## Rendering on Reactivity

Qwik components are reactive. This means that they automatically update on a state change. There are two kinds of updates:

1. A state is bound to a DOM text or attribute. Such changes usually directly update the DOM and do not require component function re-execute.
2. A state causes a structural change to the DOM (elements are created and or removed). Such changes require component function to re-execute.

The thing to keep in mind is that when state changes your component function may execute zero or more times depending on what the state is bound to. For this reason, the function should be idempotent and you should not rely on the number of times it executes.

A state change causes the component to get invalidated. When components get invalidated, they are added to the invalidation queue, which is flushed (rendered) on the next `requestAnimationFrame`. This acts as a form of coalescing for component rendering.

## Getting hold of DOM element

Use `ref` to get hold of a DOM element. Create a signal to store DOM element. Then pass the signal to the JSX `ref` property.

```tsx
import { component$, useVisibleTask$, useSignal } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  const width = useSignal(0);
  const height = useSignal(0);
  const outputRef = useSignal<Element>();
  useVisibleTask$(() => {
    if (outputRef.value) {
      const rect = outputRef.value.getBoundingClientRect();
      width.value = Math.round(rect.width);
      height.value = Math.round(rect.height);
    }
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <div ref={outputRef} style={{ border: '1px solid red', width: '100px' }}>
        Change text value here to stretch the box.
      </div>
      <div>
        The above red box is {height.value} pixels high and {width.value} pixels wide.
      </div>
    </div>
  );
});
```
<CodeSandbox src={Ref} sandboxStyle={{ height: '10em' }} />

## Lazy Loading

The component also serves an important role when breaking parent-child relationships for bundling purposes.

```tsx
export const Child = () => <span>child</span>;

const Parent = () => (
  <section>
    <Child />
  </section>
);
```

In the above example, referring to the `Parent` component implies a transitive reference to the `Child` component. When the bundler is creating a chunk, a reference to `Parent` necessitates bundling `Child` as well. (`Parent` internally refers to `Child`.) These transitive dependencies are a problem because it means that having a reference to the root component will transitively refer to the remainder of the applicationâ€”something which Qwik tries to avoid explicitly.

To avoid the above problem we don't refer to components directly, instead, we refer to the lazy wrapper. This is created automatically by the `component$()` function.

```tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const Child = component$(() => {
  return <span>child</span>;
});

export const Parent = component$(() => {
  return (
    <section>
      <Child />
    </section>
  );
});
```
<CodeSandbox src={Lazy} sandboxStyle={{ height: '10em' }} sandbox={false} />

In the above example the Optimizer transforms the above to:

```tsx
const Child = componentQrl(qrl('./chunk-a', 'Child_onMount'));
const Parent = componentQrl(qrl('./chunk-b', 'Parent_onMount'));
const Parent_onMount = () => qrl('./chunk-c', 'Parent_onRender');
const Parent_onRender = () => (
  <section>
    <Child />
  </section>
);
```

> **NOTE**
> For simplicity, not all of the transformations are shown; all resulting symbols are kept in the same file for succinctness.

Notice that after the Optimizer transforms the code, the `Parent` no longer directly references `Child`. This is important because it allows the bundler (and tree shakers) to freely move the symbols into different chunks without pulling the rest of the application with it.

So what happens when the `Parent` component needs to render a `Child` component, but the `Child` component has not yet been downloaded? First, the `Parent` component renders its DOM like so.

```html
<div>
  <section>
    <!--qv--><!--/qv-->
  </section>
</div>
```

As you can see in the above example, the `<!--qv-->` acts as a marker where the `Child` component will be inserted once it is lazy-loaded.

## Inline Components

In addition to the standard `component$()` with all of it's lazy-loaded
properties, Qwik also supports lightweight (inline) components that act more
like components in traditional frameworks.

<CodeSandbox src={InlineChild} sandboxStyle={{height: '4em'}}/>

In the above example, `MyButton` is an inline component.
Unlike the standard `component$()`, inline components cannot be individually
lazy-loaded; instead, they are bundled with their parent component. In this case:

- `MyButton` will get bundled with the `default` component.
- Whenever `default` is rendered, it will also guarantee that `MyButton` is
rendered.

You can think of inline components as being inlined into the component where they are instantiated.

### Limitations
Inline components come with some limitations that the standard `component$()`
does not have. Inline components:
- Cannot use `use` methods such as `useSignal` or `useStore`.

As the name implies, inline components are best used sparingly for
lightweight pieces of markup since they offer the convenience of being
bundled with the parent component.


## API Overview

### State

- [`useSignal(initialState)`](../state/index.mdx#usesignal) - creates a reactive value
- [`useStore(initialStateObject)`](../state/index.mdx#usestore) - creates a reactive object that can be used to store state
- [`createContextId(contextName)`](../context/index.mdx#createcontext) - creates a context reference
- [`useContextProvider()`](../context/index.mdx#usecontextprovider) - provides a value to a given context
- [`useContext()`](../context/index.mdx#usecontext) - reads the value of the current context

### Styles

- [`useStylesScoped$()`](../styles/index.mdx#usestylesscoped) - appends scoped styles to the component
- [`useStyles$()`](../styles/index.mdx#usestyles) - appends unscoped styles to the component

### Events

- [`useOn()`](../events/index.mdx) - appends a listener to the current component programatically
- [`useOnWindow()`](../events/index.mdx) - appends a listener to the window object programatically
- [`useOnDocument()`](../events/index.mdx) - appends a listener to the document object programatically

### Tasks/Lifecycle

- [`useTask$()`](../tasks/index.mdx#usetask) - defines a callback that will be called before render and/or when a watched store changes
