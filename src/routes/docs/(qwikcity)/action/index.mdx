# `routeAction$()`

Actions are similar to [loaders](/docs/(qwikcity)/route-loader/index.mdx) but they are not executed during rendering. Instead, they are executed when called explicitly, ie they run after some user interaction, such as a click or a form submission.

## Declaring an action

Actions can be declared using the `routeAction$()` or `globalAction$()`. Essencially, the do the same thing and share exactly the same API, the only difference between the two is that `routeAction$()` is scoped to a route, while `globalAction$()` is globally available across the whole app.

- `routeAction$()` can only be declared inside the `src/routes` folder, in a `layout.tsx` or `index.tsx` file, and they MUST be exported, just like a `routeLoader$(). Since `routeAction$()` are only accessible within the route it's declared, they are recommended when the action needs to access some user data, or it's a protected route. Think about it like a "private" action.

```tsx title="src/routes/form/index.tsx"
export const useChangePassword = routeAction$((data) => {
  // ...
});
```

- `globalAction$()` however, can be declared anywhere in the `src` folder. Since `globalAction$()` are globally available, they are recommended when the action needs to be shared across multiple routes, or when the action doesn't need to access any user data. For example, a `useLogin` action that logs in a user. Think about it like a "public" action.

```tsx title="src/components/login/login.tsx"
export const useLogin = globalAction$((data) => {
  // ...
});
```

> We recommend starting with `routeAction$()` and only use `globalAction$()` when you need to share an action across multiple routes, or if you wish to use the action in a component that is not a route.

## Using an action

Actions are referenced using the `.use()` method from within a Qwik Component. The `use()` method returns `ActionStore` object with methods to trigger the action and get its state.

```tsx title="src/routes/layout.tsx"
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';
import { routeAction$ } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const useAddUser = routeAction$((user) => {
  const userID = db.users.add(user);
  return {
    success: true,
    userID,
  };
});

export default component$(() => {
  const action = useAddUser();
  // action.actionPath: string;
  // action.isRunning: boolean;
  // action.status?: number;
  // action.formData: FormData | undefined;
  // action.value: {success: boolean, userID: string} | undefined;
  // action.run: (data: any) => Promise<{success: boolean, userID: string}>;

  return <>{...}</>
});
```

> Since actions are not executed during rendering, they can have side effects such as writing to a database, or sending an email. An action only runs when called explicitly.

## Using actions with `<Form/>`

The best way to trigger an action is by using the `<Form/>` component exported in `@builder.io/qwik-city`.

```tsx title="src/routes/index.tsx"
import { routeAction$, Form } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const useAddUser = routeAction$((user) => {
  const userID = db.users.add(user);
  return {
    success: true,
    userID,
  };
});

export default component$(() => {
  const action = useAddUser();
  return (
    <Form action={action}>
      <input name="name" />
      <button type="submit">Add user</button>
      {action.value?.success && <div>User added successfully</div>}
    </Form>
  );
});
```

Under the hood, the `<Form/>` component uses a native HTML `<form>` element, so it will work without JavaScript. When JS is enabled, the `<Form/>` component will intercept the form submission and trigger the action in SPA mode, allowing to have a full SPA experience.

## Using actions programatically

Actions can also be triggered programatically using the `action.run()` method, i.e. you don't need a `<Form/>` component, but you can trigger the action from a button click or any other event, just like you would do with a function.

```tsx title="src/routes/index.tsx"
import { routeAction$ } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const useAddUser = routeAction$((user) => {
  const userID = db.users.add(user);
  return {
    success: true,
    userID,
  };
});

export default component$(() => {
  const action = useAddUser();
  return (
    <div>
      <button
        onClick={async () => {
          const { value } = await action.run({ name: 'John' });
          console.log(value);
        }}
      >
        Add user
      </button>
      {action.value?.success && <div>User added successfully</div>}
    </div>
  );
});
```

In the example above, the `addUser` action is triggered when the user clicks the button. The `action.run()` method returns a `Promise` that resolves when the action is done.

### Zod validation

When submitting data to an action by default, the data is not validated.

```tsx title="src/routes/index.tsx"
import { routeAction$ } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const useAddUser = routeAction$((user) => {
  // `user` is typed Record<string, any>
  const userID = db.users.add(user);
  return {
    success: true,
    userID,
  };
});
```

Fortunately, actions have first class support for [Zod](https://zod.dev/), a TypeScript-first data validation library. To use Zod, simply pass the Zod schema as the second argument to the `routeAction$()` function.

```tsx title="src/routes/index.tsx"
import { routeAction$, zod$, z } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const useAddUser = routeAction$(
  (user) => {
    // `user` is typed { name: string }
    const userID = db.users.add(user);
    return {
      success: true,
      userID,
    };
  },
  zod$({
    name: z.string(),
  })
);
```

When submitting data to a `routeAction()`, the data is validated against the Zod schema. If the data is invalid, the action will put the validation error in the `routeAction.fail` property.

```tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';
import { routeAction$, Form, zod$, z } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const useAddUser = routeAction$(
  (user) => {
    // `user` is typed { name: string }
    const userID = db.users.add(user);
    return {
      success: true,
      userID,
    };
  },
  zod$({
    name: z.string(),
  })
);

export default component$(() => {
  const action = useAddUser();
  return (
    <Form action={action}>
      <input name="name" />
      {action.fail?.fieldErrors.name && <div>{action.fail.message}</div>}
      {action.value?.success && <div>User added successfully</div>}
      <button type="submit">Add user</button>
    </Form>
  );
});
```

Please refer to the [Zod documentation](https://zod.dev/) for more information on how to use Zod schemas.

## Action Failures

In order to return non-success values, the action must use the `fail()` method.

```tsx
import { routeAction$, zod$, z } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const useAddUser = routeAction$(
  (user, { fail }) => {
    // `user` is typed { name: string }
    const userID = db.users.add(user);
    if (!userID) {
      return fail(500, {
        message: 'User could not be added',
      });
    }
    return {
      userID,
    };
  },
  zod$({
    name: z.string(),
  })
);
```

Failures are stored in the `action.value` property, just like the success value. However, the `action.value.failed` property is set to `true` when the action fails.

```tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';
import { Form } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export default component$(() => {
  const action = useAddUser();
  return (
    <Form action={action}>
      <input name="name" />
      <button type="submit">Add user</button>
      {action.value?.failed && <div>{action.value.message}</div>}
      {action.value?.userID && <div>User added successfully</div>}
    </Form>
  );
});
```

Thanks to Typescript type discrimination, you can use the `action.value.failed` property to discriminate between success and failure.

## Previous form state

When an action is triggered, the previous state is stored in the `action.formData` property. This is useful to display a loading state while the action is running.

```tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';
import { routeAction$, Form, zod$, z } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const useAddUser = routeAction$(
  (user) => {
    // `user` is typed { name: string }
    const userID = db.users.add(user);
    return {
      userID,
    };
  },
  zod$({
    name: z.string(),
  })
);

export default component$(() => {
  const action = useAddUser();
  return (
    <Form action={action}>
      <input name="name" value={action.formData?.get('name')} />
      <button type="submit">Add user</button>
    </Form>
  );
});
```

The `action.formData` is specially useful as it allows to keep the form data filled by the user even on a page refresh, allowing to have a full SPA experience, even with JS disabled.
