# Lite Components

In addition to the standard `component$()` with all of it's lazy-loaded
properties, Qwik also supports lightweight (lite) components that act more
like traditional frameworks. Lite components may also be called inline
components.

```tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

// Lite component: declared using a standard function.
export const MyButton = (props: { text: string }) => {
  return <button>{props.text}</button>;
};

// Component: declared using `component$()`.
export const MyApp = component$(() => {
  return (
    <div>
      Some text:
      <MyButton text="Click me" />
    </div>
  );
});
```

In the above example, `MyButton` is a lite component.
Unlike the standard `component$()`, lite components cannot be individually
lazy-loaded; instead they are bundled with their parent component. In this case:

- `MyButton` will get bundled with the `MyApp` component.
- Whenever `MyApp` is rendered, it will also guarantee that `MyButton` is
rendered.
- `MyButton` does not have a [host element](../../../integrations/integration/react/#host-element).

You can think of lightweight components as being inlined into the component where they are instantiated.

## Limitations
Lite components come with some limitations that the standard `component$()`
does not have. Lite components:
- Cannot use `use` methods such as `useSignal` or `useStore`.

As the name implies, lite components are best used sparingly for
lightweight pieces of markup since they offer the convenience of being
bundled with the parent component.
