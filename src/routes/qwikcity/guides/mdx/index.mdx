# MDX

An alternative way to author content is using `.mdx` files ([Markdown JSX](https://mdxjs.com/)). These files are authored as Markdown, but they are compiled down to Qwik components. In addition to Markdown syntax, `.mdx` files can also refer to other components.

Let's assume you have your routes set up like this:

```
src/
â””â”€â”€ routes/
    â””â”€â”€ some/
        â””â”€â”€ path/
            â””â”€â”€ index.mdx    # https://example.com/some/path
```

```Markdown
---
# File: src/routes/some/path/index.mdx
title: Hello World Title
---

This is a simple hello world component.

```

The above component will be rendered at `https://example.com/some/path`.

## Importing other components.

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is a creative opportunity for you to come up with new content quickly ("Qwikly" ðŸ™‚) and if you need more interaction on your page you can seamlessly integrate your Qwik components like so:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€  counter.tsx
â””â”€â”€ routes/
    â””â”€â”€ some/
        â””â”€â”€ path/
            â””â”€â”€ index.mdx    # https://example.com/some/path
```

```Markdown
---
# File: src/routes/some/path/index.mdx
title: Hello World Title
---
import { Counter } from "../../../components/counter/counter";

This is a simple hello world component.

<Counter />

```

```tsx
// File: src/components/counter/counter.tsx
import { component$, useSignal } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const Counter = component$(() => {
  const count = useSignal(0);

  return (
    <button class="counter" type="button" onClick$={() => count.value++}>
      Increment {count.value}
    </button>
  );
});
```

**Note**: A key difference between Qwik City and many current meta-frameworks is directory-based routing. Every route needs to be defined as `a-directory/index.(tsx,ts,js,jsx,md,mdx)`.

In other meta-frameworks you're used to `about.mdx` will render a route `http://example.com/about`. However, this will not work in Qwik City. You must rename the file to `about/index.mdx` for Qwik City to know to render it.

## Disabling default MDX plugins included.

Qwik City includes 3 plugins by default.

- [remarkGfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm): [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) support (autolink literals, footnotes, strikethrough, tables, tasklists).
- [rehypeSyntaxHighlight](https://github.com/wooorm/refractor): Lightweight, robust, elegant virtual syntax highlighting using Prism.
- [rehypeAutolinkHeadings](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings): Plugin to add links to headings in HTML.

These plugins can be disabled independently in the following way:

```tsx
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { qwikCity } from '@builder.io/qwik-city/vite';
// See below
import rehypeAutolinkHeadings from 'rehype-autolink-headings';
export default defineConfig(() => {
  return {
    plugins: [
      qwikCity({
        mdxPlugins: {
          remarkGfm: false,
          rehypeSyntaxHighlight: false,
          rehypeAutolinkHeadings: false,
        },
        mdx: {
          rehypePlugins: [
            // Plugins can now be added manually to use a different configuration
            [rehypeAutolinkHeadings, { behavior: 'wrap' }],
          ],
        },
      }),
      /* the rest of the configuration */
    ],
  };
});
```
