# Qwik City - Retrieving Data

Let's implement `https://example.com/product/abc123` so that we can retrieve the details of a product.

## File layout

The first step is to structure the directories and files so that we can create the `/product/abc123` route.

```
- src/
  - routes/
    - product/
      - [skuId]/
        - index.tsx     # https://example.com/product/1234
```

## Implement onGet

In a "page" endpoint context, an `onGet` function retrieves data (typically from a database, or other stores). The retrieved data can be returned directly as JSON or used as an input to the component to render HTML. The `onGet` function receives the `params` to extract the parameters used to do data lookup.

In this example the `onGet` function returns the product data that is used inside of our component with the `useEndpoint()` function.

```typescript
// File: src/routes/product/[skuId]/details.js
import type { RequestHandler } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

interface ProductData {
  skuId: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
}

export const onGet: RequestHandler<EndpointData> = async ({ params }) => {
  // put your DB access here, we are hard coding a response for the simplicity
  return {
    skuId: params.skuId,
    price: 123.45,
    description: `Description for ${params.skuId}`,
  };
};
```

## Using onGet in a Component

An endpoint `onGet` function retrieves data and makes it available to the component using `useEndpoint()`.

```typescript
import { Resource, component$, useStore } from '@builder.io/qwik';
import type { RequestHandler } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

type EndpointData = ProductData | null;
interface ProductData { ... }
export const onGet: RequestHandler<EndpointData> = async ({ params }) => { ... };

export default component$(() => {
  const resource = useEndpoint<typeof onGet>(); // equivalent to useEndpoint<EndpointData>
  return (
    <Resource
      resource={resource}
      onPending={() => <div>Loading...</div>}
      onError={() => <div>Error</div>}
      onResolved={(product) => (
        <>
          <h1>Product: {product.productId}</h1>
          <p>Price: {product.price}</p>
          <p>{product.description}</p>
        </>
      )}
    />
  );
});
```

1. Notice that the data endpoint and the component are defined in the same file. The data endpoint is serviced by the `onGet` function and the component is by the modules default export.
2. The component uses `useEndpoint()` function to retrieve the data. The `useEndpoint()` function invokes `onGet` function directly on the server but using `fetch()` on the client. Your component does not need to think about server/client differences when using data. The `useEndpoint()` function returns an object of type `Resource`. `Resource`s are promise-like objects that can be serialized by Qwik.
3. The `onGet` function is invoked before the component. This allows the `onGet` to return 404 or redirect in case the data is not available.
4. Notice the use of `<Resource>` JSX element. The purpose of `Resource` is to allow the client to render different states of the `useEndpoint()` resource.
5. On the server the `<Resource>` element will pause rendering until the `Resource` is resolved or rejected. This is because we don't want the server to render `loading...`. (The server needs to know when the component is ready for serialization into HTML.)
6. You may use `typeof onGet` to keep your `onGet` function and `useEndpoint()` types in sync. Qwik City is smart enough to determine the types for you.

All of the above is done to abstract the data access from the component in a way that results in correct behavior on both the server and the client.
