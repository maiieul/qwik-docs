# Qwik City - Netlify Edge Middleware

Qwik City Netlify Edge middleware allows you to connect Qwik City to [Netlify Edge](https://docs.netlify.com/netlify-labs/experimental-features/edge-functions/).

Below is an example of using the built-in middleware within a user's app.

```typescript
import { qwikCity } from '@builder.io/qwik-city/middleware/netlify-edge';
import render from './entry.ssr';

const qwikCityHandler = qwikCity(render);

export default qwikCityHandler;
```
