# `routeAction$()`

Actions allows to handle form submissions in the server side, allowing to perform side effects such as writing to a database, or sending an email. They can also return data to the client, allowing to update the UI accordingly.

Actions can be declared using the `routeAction$()` or `globalAction$()` exported from `@builder.io/qwik-city`.

```tsx {4,16} /useAddUser/ /firstName/#a /lastName/#b /email/#c title="src/routes/layout.tsx"
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';
import { routeAction$, Form } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const useAddUser = routeAction$(async (data) => {
  // This will only run on the server when the user submits the form (or when the action is called programatically)
  const userID = await db.users.add({
    firstName: data.firstName,
    lastName: data.lastName,
  });
  return {
    success: true,
    userID,
  };
});

export default component$(() => {
  const action = useAddUser();

  return (
    <>
      <Form action={action}>
        <input name="firstName" />
        <input name="lastName" />
        <button type="submit">Add user</button>
      </Form>
      {action.value?.success && (
        // When the action is done successfully, the `action.value` property will contain the return value of the action
        <div>User {action.value.userID} added successfully</div>
      )}
    </>
  );
});
```

> Since actions are not executed during rendering, they can have side effects such as writing to a database, or sending an email. An action only runs when called explicitly.


## Using actions with `<Form/>`

The best way to trigger an action is by using the `<Form/>` component exported in `@builder.io/qwik-city`.

```tsx title="src/routes/index.tsx"
import { routeAction$, Form } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const useAddUser = routeAction$(async (user) => {
  const userID = await db.users.add(user);
  return {
    success: true,
    userID,
  };
});

export default component$(() => {
  const action = useAddUser();
  return (
    <Form action={action}>
      <input name="name" />
      <button type="submit">Add user</button>
      {action.value?.success && <div>User added successfully</div>}
    </Form>
  );
});
```

Under the hood, the `<Form/>` component uses a native HTML `<form>` element, so it will work without JavaScript. When JS is enabled, the `<Form/>` component will intercept the form submission and trigger the action in SPA mode, allowing to have a full SPA experience.

## Using actions programatically

Actions can also be triggered programatically using the `action.submit()` method, i.e. you don't need a `<Form/>` component, but you can trigger the action from a button click or any other event, just like you would do with a function.

```tsx {18} title="src/routes/index.tsx"
import { routeAction$ } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const useAddUser = routeAction$(async (user) => {
  const userID = await db.users.add(user);
  return {
    success: true,
    userID,
  };
});

export default component$(() => {
  const action = useAddUser();
  return (
    <div>
      <button
        onClick={async () => {
          const { value } = await action.submit({ name: 'John' });
          console.log(value);
        }}
      >
        Add user
      </button>
      {action.value?.success && <div>User added successfully</div>}
    </div>
  );
});
```

In the example above, the `addUser` action is triggered when the user clicks the button. The `action.submit()` method returns a `Promise` that resolves when the action is done.

## Zod validation

Qwik comes with built-in support for [Zod](https://zod.dev/) that can be used directly with actions, using the `zod$()` function.

Fortunately, actions have first class support for [Zod](https://zod.dev/), a TypeScript-first data validation library. To use Zod, simply pass the Zod schema as the second argument to the `routeAction$()` function.

```tsx {15-18} /firstName/#a /lastName/#b /email/#c title="src/routes/index.tsx"
import { routeAction$, zod$, z } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const useAddUser = routeAction$(
  async (user) => {
    // `user` is typed { firstName: string, lastName: string }
    const userID = await db.users.add({
      firstName: data.firstName,
      lastName: data.lastName,
    });
    return {
      success: true,
      userID,
    };
  },
  zod$({
    firstName: z.string(),
    lastName: z.string(),
  })
);

export default component$(() => {
  const action = useAddUser();
  return (
    <>
      <Form action={action}>
        <input name="firstName" />
        <input name="lastName" />

        {action.value?.failed && <div>{action.value.fieldErrors?.firstName}</div>}
        <button type="submit">Add user</button>
      </Form>
      {action.value?.success && (
        <div>User {action.value.userID} added successfully</div>
      )}
    </>
  );
});
```

When submitting data to a `routeAction()`, the data is validated against the Zod schema. If the data is invalid, the action will put the validation error in the `routeAction.value` property.

Please refer to the [Zod documentation](https://zod.dev/) for more information on how to use Zod schemas.

## Action Failures

In order to return non-success values, the action must use the `fail()` method.

```tsx /fail/
import { routeAction$, zod$, z } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const useAddUser = routeAction$(
  async (user, { fail }) => {
    // `user` is typed { name: string }
    const userID = await db.users.add(user);
    if (!userID) {
      return fail(500, {
        message: 'User could not be added',
      });
    }
    return {
      userID,
    };
  },
  zod$({
    name: z.string(),
  })
);
```

Failures are stored in the `action.value` property, just like the success value. However, the `action.value.failed` property is set to `true` when the action fails. Futhermore, failure messages can be found in the `fieldErrors` object according to properties defined in your Zod schema.

```tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';
import { Form } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export default component$(() => {
  const action = useAddUser();
  return (
    <Form action={action}>
      <input name="name" />
      <button type="submit">Add user</button>
      {action.value?.failed && <div>{action.value.fieldErrors.name}</div>}
      {action.value?.userID && <div>User added successfully</div>}
    </Form>
  );
});
```

Thanks to Typescript type discrimination, you can use the `action.value.failed` property to discriminate between success and failure.

## Previous form state

When an action is triggered, the previous state is stored in the `action.formData` property. This is useful to display a loading state while the action is running.

```tsx {12} /action.formData/
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';
import { routeAction$, Form, zod$, z } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const useAddUser = routeAction$(async (user) => {
  // handle action...
});

export default component$(() => {
  const action = useAddUser();
  return (
    <Form action={action}>
      <input name="name" value={action.formData?.get('name')} />
      <button type="submit">Add user</button>
    </Form>
  );
});
```

The `action.formData` is specially useful as it allows to keep the form data filled by the user even on a page refresh, allowing to have a full SPA experience, even with JS disabled.

## Route vs Global actions

Actions can be declared using the `routeAction$()` or `globalAction$()` exported from `@builder.io/qwik-city`, the only difference between the two is that `routeAction$()` is scoped to a route, while `globalAction$()` is globally available across the whole app.

We recommend starting with `routeAction$()` and only use `globalAction$()` when you need to share an action across multiple routes, or if you wish to use the action in a component that is not a route.

### `routeAction$()`

`globalAction$()` can only be declared inside the `src/routes` folder, in a `layout.tsx` or `index.tsx` file, and they MUST be exported, just like a `routeLoader$()`. Since `routeAction$()` are only accessible within the route it's declared, they are recommended when the action needs to access some user data, or it's a protected route. Think about it like a "private" action.

```tsx title="src/routes/form/index.tsx"
import { routeAction$ } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const useChangePassword = routeAction$((data) => {
  // ...
});
```

### `globalAction$()`

`globalAction$()` can be declared anywhere in the `src` folder. Since `globalAction$()` are globally available, they are recommended when the action needs to be shared across multiple routes, or when the action doesn't need to access any user data. For example, a `useLogin` action that logs in a user. Think about it like a "public" action.

```tsx title="src/components/login/login.tsx"
import { globalAction$ } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const useLogin = globalAction$((data) => {
  // ...
});
```
