title: Listening on Window/Document

# onWindow and onDocument

So far, we have discussed how to listen to events that originate at elements. There are events (for example, `scroll` and `mousemove`) that require that we listen to them on `window` or `document`. For this reason, Qwik allows for the `onWindow` and `onDocument` prefixes when listening for events.

```tsx
const EventExample = component$(() => {
  const store = useStore({
    scroll: 0,
    mouse: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    clickCount: 0,
  });

  return (
    <button
      onWindowScroll$={(e) => (store.scroll = window.scrollY)}
      onDocumentMousemove$={(e) => {
        store.mouse.x = e.x;
        store.mouse.y = e.y;
      }}
      onClick$={() => store.count++}
    >
      scroll: {store.scroll}
      mouseMove: {store.mouse.x}, {store.mouse.y}
      click: {store.clickCount}
    </button>
  );
});
```

The purpose of the `onWindow`/`onDocument` is to register the event at a current DOM location of the component but have it receive events from the `window`/`document`. There are two advantages to it:

1. The events can be registered declaratively in your JSX
2. The events get automatically cleaned up when the component is destroyed. (No explicit bookkeeping and cleanup is needed.)
