# Tailwind

Tailwind is a CSS framework that provides us with single-purpose utility classes which are 
opinionated for the most part, and which help us design our web pages from right inside our 
markup or .js/.jsx/.ts/.tsx files. [Tailwind Website](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Usage

You can add Tailwind easily by using the following Qwik starter script:

```bash
npm run qwik add tailwind
```

The previous command updates your app and sets the correct configuration in `vite.config.ts`.

It also adds new files inside to your `src` folder.

- `postcss.config.js` 
- `tailwind.config.js`  

## Action Required

After execute command success you need add the next lines
in your `global.css`

```css

# global.css file

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

...stuff...

```
