title: Qwik City - Named Layout

# Qwik City - Named Layout

At times related routes need to have drastically different layouts from their siblings. It is possible to define multiple layouts for different sibling routes. A single default layout and any number of named layouts. The child route can then request a specific named-layout.
Qwik City defines the convention that layouts start with `_layout`. That's why the default layout is namend `_layout.tsx`. A named layout also starts with `_layout` followed by its unique name: `_layout-narrow.tsx`

```
- src/
  - routes/
    - _layout.tsx         # Default layout implementation
    - _layout-narrow.tsx  # Default named layout implementation
    - home.tsx            # http://server/home (Layout used: _layout.tsx)
    - contact@narrow.tsx  # http://server/contact (Layout used: _layout-narrow.tsx)
```

- `http://server/home`
  ```
