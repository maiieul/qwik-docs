# Best Practices

## Avoid registering events eagerly with `useVisibleTask$()`

> ⚠ Use `useVisibleTask$()` with caution ⚠

**`Suboptimal Implantation`**:

```tsx
useVisibleTask$(() => {
  const listener = (event) => {
    const mouseEvent = event as MouseEvent;
    console.log(mouseEvent.x, mouseEvent.y);
  };
  document.addEventListener('mousemove', listener);

  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('mousemove', listener);
  };
});
```

**`Issue`**:
The above implementation causes more JavaScript to load eagerly, rather than responding precisely to user events. Increased upfront JavaScript loading results in slower app performance.

Additionally, it demands that developers maintain a higher awareness of the server/client relationship, despite the initial preference for `use > Visible < Task`.

Ideally, the framework should minimize the need for developers to focus on this aspect.

Moreover, the implementation necessitates manual cleanup of the listener, adding extra effort for developers.

**`Optimal Implantation`**:

```tsx
useOnDocument(
  'mousemove',
  $((event) => {
    const mouseEvent = event as MouseEvent;
    console.log(mouseEvent.x, mouseEvent.y);
    // No manual clean up required!
  })
);
```

When in doubt, instead of `useVisibleTask$()` use:
- `useOn()`: listen to events on the root element of `the current component`.
- `useOnWindow()`: listen to events on the `window` object.
- `useOnDocument()`: listen to events on the `document` object.

## Avoid accessing the location from the `window` object

⚠ Don't access `window.location` directly ⚠

**Suboptimal Implantation(s)**:

```tsx
useVisibleTask$(()=> {
    if (window.location.href).includes('foo') {
        //... do the thing
    }
})
```

```tsx
//(in the root of a component)
if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
    const queryParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
    const query: Record<string, string> = {};
    queryParams.forEach((value, key) => {
        query[key] = value;
    })
    doTheThing(query);
}
```
**`Issue`**:

Many actions related to location information can be executed during the initial server-side render, resulting in pure HTML without any JavaScript overhead.

By forcing this logic to run on the client side, it introduces increased upfront JavaScript and leads to eager loading.

Using the if typeof window !== "undefined" pattern may cause the code to be skipped. On the server, the code block will be skipped since the window is always undefined.

While developers may be accustomed to code running twice, Qwik eliminates this necessity by providing a more efficient approach.

**Optimal Implantation(s)**:

```tsx
const location = useLocation();

if (location.url.href.includes('foo')) {
  // Do the thing
}
```

```tsx
const location = useLocation();

doTheThing(location.url.searchParams);
```

## EXCEPTION

When using SSG for purely static files, it's inevitable to rely on the server without current location information during the build time.

However, exercise caution! If the required information (such as query parameters) isn't needed until a user event occurs, incorporate the check within your event handling code.

This approach helps to prevent eager loading of JavaScript and improves performance.
