# Endpoints

As we discussed previously, an endpoint in Qwik City is `folders + an index`.

For `index.md` and `index.mdx` files [more here](../../../qwikcity/content/mdx/index.mdx), these endpoints will just return HTML and nothing else. For this section, we will focus on index.ts and index.tsx endpoints.

## Page & Data Endpoints

In Qwik City, "Page" and "Data" endpoints are the same except for one difference: a page exports a default component$ to render html. To learn about defining a page component, you can (read more here)[qwikcity/content/component]. A quick example would look like this:

```typescript
// File: src/routes/some/path/index.tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

// Notice the default export
export default component$(() => {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
});
```

In the following sections, we'll look at the other things we can do within endpoint files.
