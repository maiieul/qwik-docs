# Netlify Edge Middleware

Qwik City Netlify Edge middleware allows you to connect Qwik City to [Netlify Edge](https://docs.netlify.com/netlify-labs/experimental-features/edge-functions/).

## Get started

Run this command to integrate netlify-edge with your app

```bash
npm run qwik add netlify-edge
```

The previous command will create `src/entry.netlify-edge.tsx` using the built-in middleware within a user's app.

```typescript
import { qwikCity } from '@builder.io/qwik-city/middleware/netlify-edge';
import render from './entry.ssr';

const qwikCityHandler = qwikCity(render);

export default qwikCityHandler;
```

`vite.config.ts`

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { qwikVite } from "@builder.io/qwik/optimizer";
import { qwikCity } from "@builder.io/qwik-city/vite";
import tsconfigPaths from "vite-tsconfig-paths";
+import netlifyEdge from "@netlify/vite-plugin-netlify-edge";

export default defineConfig(() => {
  return {
    plugins: [
      qwikCity(),
      qwikVite({
+        ssr: {
+          outDir: "netlify/edge-functions",
+        },
      }),
      tsconfigPaths(),
+      netlifyEdge({
+        functionName: "entry.netlify-edge",
+      }),
    ],
  };
});
```

Configure `netlify.toml`

```toml
[[edge_functions]]
path = "/*"
function = "entry.netlify-edge"
```

## Usage

Along with client build, run vite command to perform SSR build

```bash
vite build --ssr src/entry.netlify-edge.tsx
```

Now you can use Netlify CLI to preview or deploy. [Read the full guide here](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik/blob/main/starters/servers/netlify-edge/README.md)
