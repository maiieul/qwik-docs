# Capturing the lexical scope

The Optimizer extracts expressions (usually functions) into new files and leaves behind a `QRL` pointing to the lazy-loaded location.

Let's look at a simple case:

```tsx
const Greeter = component$(() => {
  return <span>Hello World!</span>;
});
```

this will result in:

```tsx
const Greeter = component(qrl('./chunk-a.js', 'Greeter_onMount'));
```

`chunk-a.js`:

```tsx
const Greeter_onMount = () => {
  return qrl('./chunk-b.js', 'Greeter_onRender');
};
```

`chunk-b.js`:

```tsx
const Greeter_onRender = () => <span>Hello World!</span>;
```

The above is for simple cases where the extracted function closure does not capture any variables. Let's look at a more complicated case where the extracted function closure lexically captures variables.

```tsx
const Greeter = component$((props: { name: string }) => {
  const salutation = 'Hello';

  return (
    <span>
      {salutation} {props.name}!
    </span>
  );
});
```

The naive way to extract functions will not work.

```tsx
const Greeter = component(qrl('./chunk-a.js', 'Greeter_onMount'));
```

`chunk-a.js`:

```tsx
const Greeter_onMount = (props) => {
  const salutation = 'Hello';
  return qrl('./chunk-b.js', 'Greeter_onRender');
};
```

`chunk-b.js`:

```tsx
const Greeter_onRender = () => (
  <span>
    {salutation} {props.name}!
  </span>
);
```

The issue can be seen in `chunk-b.js`. The extracted function refers to `salutation` and `props`, which are no longer in the lexical scope of the function. For this reason, the generated code must be slightly different.

`chunk-a.js`:

```tsx
const Greeter_onMount = (props) => {
  const salutation = 'Hello';
  return qrl('./chunk-b.js', 'Greeter_onRender', [salutation, props]);
};
```

`chunk-b.js`:

```tsx
const Greeter_onRender = () => {
  const [salutation, props] = useLexicalScope();

  return (
    <span>
      {salutation} {props.name}!
    </span>
  );
};
```

Notice two changes:

1. The `QRL` in `Greeter_onMount` now stores the `salutation` and `props`. This performs the role of capturing the constants inside closures.
2. The generated closure `Greeter_onRender` now has a preamble which restores the `salutation` and `props` (`const [salutation, props] = useLexicalScope()`.)

The ability for the Optimizer (and Qwik runtime) to capture lexically scoped constants significantly improves which functions can be extracted into lazy-loaded resources. It is a powerful tool for breaking up complex applications into smaller lazy-loadable chunks.
