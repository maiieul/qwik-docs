#  Qwik City - Head Title

HTML places the `<head>` tag right after the start of `<body>`. The `<head>` section is not something that your route component renders directly, yet you still need to control its content. This can be achieved by exporting a `head` property (or function.) from your component.


Assume this file layout.
```
- src/
  - routes/
    - product/
      - [skuId]/
        - details.js     # https://example.com/product/1234/details
```

If all we need to do is set the title of the page, we can do it in the `head` (and optional `meta`, `links` and `styles`) export of the component like so:
```typescript
// File: src/routes/product/[skuId]/details.js
import {component$} from '@builder.io/qwik';
import {DocumentHead} from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export default component$(() => {...});

export const head: DocumentHead = {
  title: 'Product Details',
  meta: [...],
  links: [...],
  styles: [...],
};
```

The above case works for simple situations where we just want to set the title of the page to a static value. In a case where we need to set the title dynamically, for example, to include the product title, we can use a function:

```typescript
// File: src/routes/product/[skuId]/details.js
import {component$} from '@builder.io/qwik';
import {DocumentHead} from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

type EndpointData = ProductData | null;

interface ProductData {
  skuId: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
}
export const onGet: RequestHandler<EndpointData> = async ({ params }) => { ... };

export default component$(() => {...});

export const head: DocumentHead = (props: DocumentHeadProps<EndpointData>): ResolvedDocumentHead => {
  return {
    title: `Product - ` + props.data.description
  };
};
```

The second case is a bit more complicated but it showcases how we can set the title of the page with the value that is retrieved from the `onGet` endpoint. (See [endpoint documentation](/qwikcity/endpoint/data) for retrieving data.) The Qwik City invokes `onGet` to retrieve the data for the route and then passes the data to the `head` function allowing it to create a custom title.
