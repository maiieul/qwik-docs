# State

State management is an important part of any app. In Qwik, we can differentiate between two types of state, reactive and static:
1. Static state is anything that can be serialized: a string, number, object, array... anything.
2. A reactive state on the other hand is created with `useSignal()` or `useStore()`.

It is important to notice that state in Qwik is not necessarily a local component state, but rather an app state that can be instantiated by any component.

## `useSignal()`

Use `useSignal()` to create a reactive signal (a form of state). The `useSignal()` takes an initial value and returns a reactive signal.

The reactive signal returned by `useSignal()` consists of an object with a single property `.value`. If you change the `value` property of the signal, any component that depends on it will be updated automatically.

### Example

This example shows how `useSignal()` can be used in a counter component to keep track of the count.

<CodeExample src={CounterSignal} sandboxStyle={{height: '6em'}}/>

Modifying the `count.value` property will cause the component to be updated automatically. For instance, when the property is changed in the button click handler as in the example above.

## `useStore()`

Works very similarly to `useSignal()`, but it takes an object as its initial value. One can think of a store as a multiple-value signal or an object made of several signals.

Use `useStore(initialStateObject)` hook to create a reactive object. It takes an initial object (or a factory function) and returns a reactive object.

> **NOTE**
> For reactivity to work as expected, make sure to keep a reference to the reactive object and not only to its properties. e.g. doing `let { count } = useStore({ count: 0 })` and then mutating `count` won't trigger updates of components that depend on the property.

### Example

This example shows how `useStore()` can be used in a counter component to keep track of the count.

<CodeExample src={CounterStore} sandboxStyle={{height: '6em'}}/>

### Recursive values

By default, [`useStore()`](/docs/(qwik)/components/state/index.mdx#usestore) only tracks the top-level properties in your store, which means that for an update to be registered, you have to update values at the top level property.

<CodeExample src={CounterStoreNoTrack} sandboxStyle={{height: '6em'}}/>

For the updates to be registered with the default tracking strategy, we would have to update the top-level `nested` field like so:

```ts
store.nested = { fields: { are: "tracked" } }
```

To make the first example work, we can pass a second argument to `useStore()`, and tell it to use recursion to track all the values in our store, no matter how deep.

<CodeExample src={CounterStoreDeep} sandboxStyle={{height: '6em'}}/>

Now, the component will update as expected. This will also track individual values inside of arrays!

## Passing a store to other components

One of the nice features of Qwik is that the state can be passed to other components. Writing to the store will then only re-render the components which read from the store only.

There are two ways to pass state to other components: 
1. pass state to child component explicitly using props, 
2. or pass state implicitly through context.

### Using props

The simplest way to pass the state to other components is to pass it through props.

<CodeExample src={StorePassingProps} sandboxStyle={{height: '6em'}}/>

### Using context

The context API is a way to pass state to components without having to pass it through props (i.e.: avoids prop drilling issues). Automatically, all the descendant components in the tree can access a reference to the state with read/write access to it.

Check the [context API](../context/index.mdx) for more information.

<CodeExample src={StorePassingContext} sandboxStyle={{height: '6em'}}/>


## Computed values

Computed values are values that are derived from other values. They are useful when you have a value that is derived from other values, and you want to keep it in sync with the other values.

In Qwik there are two ways to create computed values, using [`useTask$()`](/docs/(qwik)/components/lifecycle/index.mdx#usetask) or [`useResource$()`](/docs/(qwik)/components/resource/index.mdx).

The main difference between the two is that [`useTask$()`](/docs/(qwik)/components/lifecycle/index.mdx#usetask) allows side effects and the execution is serialized, while [`useResource$()`](/docs/(qwik)/components/resource/index.mdx) is asynchronous and multiple `useResource$()` calls can happen in parallel.

`useTask$()` is usually used to compute intermediate state, while [`useResource$()`](/docs/(qwik)/components/resource/index.mdx) has better ergonomics to compute the final state, used for rendering. Let's see some examples:

### [`useTask$()`](/docs/(qwik)/components/lifecycle/index.mdx#usetask) example

```tsx
import { component$, useStore, useTask$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  const state = useStore({
    count: 0,
    doubleCount: 0,
  });

  useTask$(({ track }) => {
    track(() => state.count);
    state.doubleCount = state.count * 2;
  });

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick$={() => state.count++}>Increment</button>
      Count: {state.count}
      Count * 2: {state.doubleCount}
    </>
  );
});
```

### [`useResource$()`](/docs/(qwik)/components/resource/index.mdx) example

```tsx
import { component$, useStore, useResource$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  const state = useStore({
    count: 0,
  });

  const doubleCount = useResource$(({ track }) => {
    track(() => state.count);
    return state.count * 2;
  });

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick$={() => state.count++}>Increment</button>
      Count: {state.count}
      Count * 2: {doubleCount.promise}
    </>
  );
});
```

Both [`useTask()`](../lifecycle/index.mdx#usetask) and [`useResource()`](../resource/index.mdx) are explained in detail in their respective sections.

## Reactivity

Thanks to the fine grained reactivity of Qwik, only the components that depend on the state will be updated. This is a huge performance gain, as only the components that need to be updated will be updated.

## `noSerialize()`

Sometimes, you may want to store a value in the state, but you don't want it to be serialized. This is useful for storing values that are not serializable, like functions, or classes.

```tsx
import { component$, useStore, noSerialize, useVisibleTask$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const App = component$(() => {
  const state = useStore({
    monacoInstance: null,
  });

  useVisibleTask$(() => {
    // Monaco is not serializable, so we can't store it in the state using `noSerialize()`
    state.monacoInstance = noSerialize(new Monaco());
  });
  return <></>;
});
```
