# PostCSS

PostCSS allows developers to write modern CSS while still maintaining backwards compatibility and improving performance. It parses CSS code and passes it through a series of plugins that can modify, optimize, and extend the CSS before outputting the final result. [PostCSS Website](https://postcss.org/)

## Usage

You can add PostCSS to your project by using the following Qwik starter script:

```shell
npm run qwik add postcss
```

The previous command updates your app and sets the correct configuration in `vite.config.ts`.

It also adds a new file in your `src` folder.

- `postcss.config.js`

```
