# Qwik City - MDX

An alternative way to author content is using `.mdx` files. (Markdown JSX.) These files are authored as Markdown, but they are compiled down to Qwik components. In addition to Markdown syntax, `.mdx` files can also refer to other components.

Let's assume you have the router set up such as this:
```
- src/
  - routes/
    - some/           
      - path/
        - index.mdx              # http://server/some/path
```

```Markdown
---
# File: src/routes/some/path/index.mdx
title: Hello World Title
---

This is a simple hello world component.

```

The above component will be rendered at `http://server/some/path`. 

## Importing other components.

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is a creative opportunity for you to come up with new content quickly ("Qwikly" ðŸ™‚) and if you need more interaction on your page you can seamlessly integrate your Qwik components like so:

```
- src/
  - components/
    - counter.tsx
  - routes/
    - some/           
      - path/
        - index.mdx              # http://server/some/path
```

```Markdown
---
# File: src/routes/some/path/index.mdx
title: Hello World Title
---
import { Counter } from "../../../components/counter/counter";

This is a simple hello world component.

<Counter />

```

```typescript
// File: src/components/counter/counter.tsx
import { component$, useScopedStyles$, useStore } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const Counter = component$(() => {
  const store = useStore({ count: 0 });

  return (
    <button class="counter" type="button" onClick$={() => store.count++}>
      Increment {store.count}
    </button>
  );
});
```
