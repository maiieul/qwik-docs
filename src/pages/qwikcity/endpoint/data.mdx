# Qwik City - Retrieving Data

Let's implement `http://server/product/abc123/details` so that we can retrieve the details of a product.

## File layout

The first step is to layout out the files so that we can accept `http://server/product/abc123/details`.

```
- src/
  - routes/
    - product/
      - [skuId]/
        - details.js     # http://server/product/1234/details
```

## Implement Endpoint

An endpoint is a `doGet` function that retrieves data (typically from a database, or other stores.) The retrieved data can be returned directly as JSON or used as an input to the component to render HTML. The `doGet` function receives the `params` to extract the parameters used to do data lookup.

The `doGet` function returns an object that contains:
- `status`: HTTP status code
- `headers`: HTTP headers to control caches etc...
- `body`: The body of the response to be returned as JSON or to be used as input to the HTML.

```typescript
// File: src/routes/product/[skuId]/details.js
import { EndpointHandler } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

type EndpointData = ProductData | null;

interface ProductData {
  skuId: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
}
export const onGet: EndpointHandler<EndpointData> = async ({ params }) => {
  // put your DB access here, wer are hard coding response for simplicity of this tutorial.
  return {
    status: 200,
    body: {
      skuId: params.skuId,
      price: 123.45,
      description: `Description for ${params.skuId}`,
    },
    headers: {
      'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-store',
    },
  };
};
```

## Using Endpoint in Component

An endpoint `doGet` function retrieves data and makes it available as JSON. The next step is to convert the JSON to HTML. This is done with a standard component as described [Components](/qwikcity/content/component). What is new is `useEndpoint()` to retrieve the data from the `doGet` function.
  
```typescript
import { Resource, component$, Host, useStore } from '@builder.io/qwik';
import { EndpointHandler } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

type EndpointData = ProductData | null;
interface ProductData { ... }
export const onGet: EndpointHandler<EndpointData> = async ({ params }) => { ... };

export default component$(() => {
  const resource = useEndpoint<EndpointData>();
  return (
    <Resource 
      resource={resource}
      onPending={() => <div>Loading...</div>}
      onError={() => <div>Error</div>}
      onResolved={() => (
        <>
          <h1>Product: {product.productId}</h1>
          <p>Price: {product.price}</p>
          <p>{product.description}</p>
        </>
      )}
    />
  );
});
```

1. Notice that the data endpoint and the component are defined in the same file. The data endpoint is serviced by the `doGet` function and the component is by the modules default export.
2. The component uses `useEndpoint()` function to retrieve the data. The `useEndpoint()` function invokes `doGet` function directly on the server but using `fetch()` on the client. Your component does not need to think about server/client differences when using data. The `useEndpoint()` function returns an object of type `Resource`. `Resource`s are promise-like objects that can be serialized by Qwik. 
3. The `doGet` function is invoked before the component. This allows the `doGet` to return 404 or redirect in case the data is not available. 
4. Notice the use of `<Resource>` JSX element. The purpose of `Resource` is to allow the client to render different states of the `useEndpoint()` resource. 
5. On the server the `<Resource>` element will pause rendering until the `Resource` is resolved or rejected. This is because we don't want the server to render `loading...`. (The server needs to know when the component is ready for serialization into HTML.)

All of the above is done to abstract the data access from the component in a way that results in correct behavior on both the server and the client.
