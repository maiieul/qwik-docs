# Qwik City - Pathless

At times components get so complex that using `index.ts` is not enough, and they need their own directory structure. In that case, Qwik City allows you to place the component into its own directory prefixed with `__`. Qwik City will then not use that directory name in the user URL.

```
- src/
  - routes/
    - some/           
      - path/
        - __complex-component/      # Notice the double underscore prefix
          - index.tsx              # https://example.com/some/path  (the _complex-component folder is ignored)
          - other_component.tsx   # this file is ignored and not mapped to any URL because of the leading underscore.
```
