# Lifecycles

## `useMount$()`

- **Trigger:** component mount
- **When:** before rendering and resources
- **Times:** exactly once per component instance
- **Platform:** server and browser

`useMount$()` registers a hook to be executed upon component creation. `useMount$()` will block the rendering of the component until after the `useMount$()` callback resolves. (This is useful for fetching asynchronous data and delaying rendering until data is received, ensuring that the rendered component contains the data)

While `useMount$()` can execute on either the server or on the client, it runs exactly once. (Either on the server or on the client, depending on where the component got first rendered)

See also the `useServerMount$()` hook which has the same semantics but only runs on the server.

### Example

```tsx
export const Cmp = component$(() => {
  const store = useStore({
    users: [],
  });
  useMount$(async () => {
    // This code will run on component creation to fetch the data.
    store.users = await db.requestUsers();
  });
  return (
    <>
      {store.users.map((user) => (
        <User user={user} />
      ))}
    </>
  );
});

interface User {
  name: string;
}

export function User(props: { user: User }) {
  return <div>Name: {props.user.name}</div>;
}
```

### When to use `useMount$()`

You wanna run some code ONLY when the component mounts, once.

## `useServerMount$()`

- **Trigger:** component mount
- **When:** before rendering and resources
- **Times:** exactly once per component instance
- **Platform:** server only

`useServerMount$()` registers a server-mounted hook that only runs on the server when the component is first mounted.

### Example

```tsx
export const Cmp = component$(() => {
  const store = useStore({
    users: [],
  });
  useServerMount$(async () => {
    // This code will ONLY run once in the server, when the component is mounted
    store.users = await db.requestUsers();
  });
  return (
    <>
      {store.users.map((user) => (
        <User user={user} />
      ))}
    </>
  );
});

interface User {
  name: string;
}

export function User(props: { user: User }) {
  return <div>Name: {props.user.name}</div>;
}
```

## `useClientMount$()`

- **Trigger:** component mount
- **When:** before rendering and resources
- **Times:** exactly once per component instance
- **Platform:** browser only

`useClientMount$()` registers a client-mounted hook that only runs on the browser when the component is first mounted.

### Example

```tsx
export const Cmp = component$(() => {
  const store = useStore({
    option: string,
  });
  useClientMount$(() => {
    // This code will ONLY run once in the browser, when the component is mounted
    store.option = localStorage.getItem('option');
  });
  return <>Localstore: {store.option}</>;
});
```

## `useWatch$()`

- **Trigger:** component mount and on tracked state changes
- **When:** before rendering and resources
- **Times:** at least once
- **Platform:** server and browser

Just like `useMount$()`, the hook is called the first time when the component mounts, however it can be called multiple times if (and only if) it tracks a [signal and store](/docs/components/state/index.mdx) for changes.

> `useWatch$()` is different from React's useEffect in that, `useWatch` also runs during SSR and before rendering.

### Example

The `useWatch$()` function is used to observe the `state.count` property. Any changes to the `state.count` cause the `watchFn` to execute which in turn updates the `state.doubleCount` to the double of `state.count`.

```tsx
import { component$, useStore, useWatch$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const Cmp = component$(() => {
  const store = useStore({
    count: 1,
    doubleCount: 0,
  });

  useWatch$(({ track }) => {
    const count = track(() => store.count);
    store.doubleCount = 2 * count;
  });

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        {store.count} / {store.doubleCount}
      </div>
    </>
  );
});
```

The example above uses the `track` function to watch changes in `() => store.count`. The callback will run once in the SSR when the component is mounted and every time `store.count` changes.

> Notice that `useWatch$()` runs BEFORE the actual rendering and in the server, so manual DOM manipulation need to be done with carefulness.

> See also the `useClientEffect$()` hook that shares similar semantics but only runs on the client after rendering.

### When to use `useWatch$()`

You wanna mutate some state, or perform some action when some state changes. Ie, you need to have some side effects.

> Note, if you wanna load some data (for example a fetch()), to later use that in your component, look at [`useResource$()`](/docs/components/resource/index.mdx). This API will be even more efficiently leveraging SSR streaming and parallelisim.

## `useClientEffect$()`

- **Trigger:** component mount and on tracked state changes
- **When:** after rendering
- **Times:** at least once
- **Platform:** browser only

Similarly to `useWatch$()` or `useMount$()` this hook will also run at least once, but it will never RUN in the server, that is, it will run only in the browser.

For all components that got mounted during SSR (in the server), the `useClientEffect$()` will run eagarly, that means, without user interaction, but the eagarness can be configured!

```tsx
useClientEffect$(() => console.log('runs in the browser'), {
  eagerness: 'visible', // 'load' | 'visible' | 'idle'
});
```

This is a unique feature of Qwik, any other frameworks would execute this and other code as part of hydration, but in Qwik, we can even specify when it happens:

- `"visible"`: when the component becomes visible in the viewport (uses [Intersection Observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) under the hood). This is the default value.
- `"load"`: when the documents finish loading (the document's "load" event)
- `"idle"`: after load the first moment the site becomes idle. It uses [`requestIdleCallback()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback) under the hood.

Like `useWatch`

### Example

```tsx
export const Timer = component$(() => {
  const store = useStore({
    count: 0,
  });
  useClientEffect$(() => {
    // Only runs in the client
    const timer = setInterval(() => {
      store.count++;
    }, 500);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(timer);
    };
  });
  return <>{store.count}</>;
});
```

> **NOTE:** Don't abuse `useClientEffect$()` when the same logic can be achieved using `useWatch$()` or other means. Ask to yourself: Does this code really need to run at the beginning in the browser? If the answer is no, `useClientEffect$()` is probably not the right answer.

> How does it compare with React's `useEffect()`? Both APIs share a lot of semantics, but while both run AFTER rendering,`useClientEffect$()` can run also independently from rendering.

### When to use `useClientEffect$()`

You need to run JS right at loading time of the page, even if the user never interacts with the page.

- Initialize some animations
- WebGL logic
- Read some `localStorage`
- Runs some code without user interaction

## Use Method Rules

When using lifecycle hooks, you must adhere to the following rules:

- They can only be called in `component$`
- They can only be called at the root level of a function / arrow function context, not inside of branches or conditional blocks
- They can only be called from another `use*$` method, allowing for composition

```tsx
useHook(); // <-- ❌ does not work

export default component$(() => {
  useCustomHook(); // <-- ✅ does work
  if (condition) {
    useHook(); // <-- ❌ does not work
  }
  const myQrl = $(() => useHook()); // <-- ❌ does not work
  return <button onClick$={() => useHook()}></button>; // <-- ❌ does not work
});

const useCustomHook = () => {
  useHook(); // <-- ✅ does work
};
```
