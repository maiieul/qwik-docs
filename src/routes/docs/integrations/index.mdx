# Integrations

Qwik CLI comes with integrations to make it easy to connect to your tooling and services.

Once you create a Qwik City application, run the following command to add new integrations:

```shell
npm run qwik add
```

It will prompt you to select the integration you want to add. Once you select an integration, it will be added to your application and you can start using it.
