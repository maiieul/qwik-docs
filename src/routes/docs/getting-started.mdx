# Getting Started Qwikly

Qwik is a new kind of framework that is [resumable](./concepts/resumable.mdx) (No JS and no hydration), built for the edge and familiar for React developers.

- [Stackblitz Qwik + Vite](https://stackblitz.com/edit/qwik-vite-todoapp?file=index.html)
- [Examples playground](/examples/reactivity/counter)


## Prerequisites

- `node.js` v14 or higher (with `npm`)
- Your favorite IDE (vscode recommended)
- Start to [think qwik](./think-qwik.mdx)

## Creating an app using the CLI

The first step is to create an application. Qwik comes with a CLI that allows you to create a basic working skeleton of an application. We will use the CLI to create a blank starter so that you can quickly familiarize yourself with it.

### Run the Qwik CLI in your shell

```shell
$ npm init qwik@latest
```

The CLI will guide you through an interactive menu to set the project-name and select one of the starters:

<script id="asciicast-7Ielp9cJZfy0MglQvOxBLgUqF" src="https://asciinema.org/a/7Ielp9cJZfy0MglQvOxBLgUqF.js" async></script>

After your new app is created, you will see an output like the following in your terminal:

```shell
💫 Let's create a Qwik app 💫

✔ Project name … qwik-app
✔ Select a starter › Blank
✔ Features › Prettier

⭐️ Success! Project saved in qwik-app directory

🤖 Next steps:
   cd qwik-app
   npm install
   npm start

```

At this point, you will have `qwik-app` directory, that contains the starter app.

## Running in development

Once the application is download.

1. Change into the directory created by the `npm init qwik@latest`.

```shell
cd qwik-app
```

2. Install NPM modules:

```shell
npm install
```

3. Invoke the dev server

```shell
npm start
```

4. You should see a server running with your To-do application

```shell

  VITE v3.0.2  ready in 140 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5174/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose


```

5. Visit http://localhost:5174/ to explore the app.

## Commands

Here are some useful commands to get you started. For a complete list please refer to `package.json`.

- `npm start`: alias to `npm run dev` (this currently defaults to running dev.ssr)
- `npm run dev.client`: starts the dev server in client bootstrap mode
- `npm run dev.ssr`: starts the dev server with SSR
- `npm run build`: builds the application for production
