# ðŸ§ª Insights 
**Stage:** `prototyping`

Insights allows your application to collect real user usage information to optimize the creation of bundles. By observing real user behavior the Qwik build system can than do a better job of placing symbols which are used together into a same chunk and thus minimizing the waterfall effect which could occur if there are too many small files that need to be downloaded.

## Architecture

The optimization consists of these parts:
- A `<Insights>` component which collects real user usage data.
- A hosted application with a database. (http://qwik-insights.builder.io)
- a vite time plugin which provides the bundle information.

## `<Insights>` component

The `<Insights>` component should be added to your `root.tsx` file.

```typescript
// ...
import { Insights } from '@builder.io/qwik-labs';

export default component$(() => {
  // ...
  return (
    <QwikCityProvider>
      <head>
        // ...
        <Insights
          publicApiKey={import.meta.env.PUBLIC_QWIK_INSIGHTS_KEY}
        />
      </head>
      <body lang="en">
        // ...
      </body>
    </QwikCityProvider>
  );
});
```

You can get `PUBLIC_QWIK_INSIGHTS_KEY` by visiting https://qwik-insights.builder.io/ and creating an application.

The `<Insights>` component collects this data:
- Timing information of symbols.
- The `pathname` part of the URL.
- Random sessionID which identifies which symbol loads came from the same browser session.

NOTE: The `<Insights>` component does not collect any user identifiable information.

The information collected is sent to https://qwik-insights.builder.io/ for storage. 

## Hosted application

The https://qwik-insights.builder.io/ is hosted part of the Insights which keeps statistical usage information on the application symbols. (The implementation of the service is open source, and you may chose to use ours or host your own. This may become a paid service in the future.)

## Vite integration

Once the application is running for a while and it collects sufficient information on symbol usage, the stats can be used to improve the bundles of the future version of the application. This is done by connecting the vite build with Insights like so:

file: `vite.config.js`
```typescript
//..
import { defineConfig, loadEnv } from 'vite';
import { Insights } from '@builder.io/qwik-labs';


export default defineConfig(async () => {
  return {
    plugins: [
      qwikVite({
        entryStrategy: await insightsEntryStrategy({
          publicApiKey: loadEnv('', '.').PUBLIC_QWIK_INSIGHT_KEY,
        }),
      }), 
      //...
    ],
    // ...
  };
});
```
