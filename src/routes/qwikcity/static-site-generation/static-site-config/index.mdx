# Static Site Generation Config

Static site generation is created from the built in adapter, to create an adapter run:

```shell
npm run qwik add
```

Select `Adapter: Static site (.html files)`. Done!

## Changes

Running the above command will make the following changes to your project:

- A `build.server` script will be automatically added to your `package.json` file.
- A `adaptors/vite.config.ts` file will be created.

In node you can run the generation after building using:

```shell
node server/entry.ssr.js
```

Your build files will be generated into the `dist` folder.

## SSG Config

The `adaptors/vite.config.ts` file also includes the SSG config, which would be custom for each implementation.

### `origin`

The URL `origin`, which is a combination of the scheme (protocol) and hostname (domain). For example, `https://qwik.builder.io` has the protocol `https://` and domain `qwik.builder.io`. However, the `origin` does _not_ include a `pathname`.

The `origin` is used to provide a full URL during Static Site Generation (SSG), and to simulate a complete URL rather than just the `pathname`. For example, in order to render a correct canonical tag URL or URLs within the `sitemap.xml`, the `origin` must be provided too.

If the site also starts with a pathname other than `/`, please use the `basePathname` option in the Qwik City config options.

### `outDir`

The `outDir` is a file system output directory where the static files should be written. In the example above, it's using Node's [fileURLToPath](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#urlfileurltopathurl) to create an absolute file system path to write the static HTML files to.

## Javascript Runtimes

For a Javascript project, it's quite common for the build's runtime to be built on top of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/). However, the core of Qwik City static site generation isn't tied to using only Node.js, which is why the `qwikCityGenerate()` function is imported from `@builder.io/qwik-city/static/node`. By scoping the generate function to a specific runtime, such as Node.js, this gives Qwik City the flexibility to also generate SSG from other runtimes in the future, such as [Deno](https://deno.land/) or [Bun](https://bun.sh/).
