# Qwik City (routing)
*aka. Qwik Router*

Learning Qwik and Qwik City are not two different things, Qwik City is built on top of Qwik, bringing opiniated routing and goodies to make your life easier.

> Qwik¹ City²
>
> [**Qwik¹**](../../docs/overview/index.mdx): Core framework, stable, primivates, component model.
>
> [**City²**](../directory-layout/index.mdx): Opiniated files-based router, build fast.

We call it a **meta-framework** for Qwik. Qwik City is to Qwik, what [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) is to React, what [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) is to Vue, or [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) to Svelte.

Qwik (core) and Qwik City (routing) solve problems at two layers of abstraction. **Qwik can stay stable**, without breaking changes, focusing in long-term and stable primitives, while Qwik City brings an **opiniated and performant way to build sites at scale**. We don't want to lock the ecosystem into a single correct way of building sites, in fact we encourge the community to build alternative solutions on top Qwik.

> As an user, using Qwik City today for your app is a no-brainer. Thanks to Qwik architecture, it comes with zero overhead, no extra JS will be delivered to the browser.


Use Qwik City to build an e-commerce website, blog site, or any other website that needs routing, layouts, templating, data retrieval/updates, and behavior. Qwik City is built on Qwik, and therefore Qwik City sites are resumable and only download the minimal amount of JavaScript with fine-grained lazy loading.

Qwik City provides:

- Directory-based routing
- Nested layouts
- File-based menus
- Breadcrumbs
- Support authoring content with `.tsx` or `.mdx` file formats
- Data endpoints

Qwik City sites are fast by default:

- Are resumable
- Download minimal JavaScript
- Come with Partytown

To follow along with this guide, run the Qwik CLI in your command line:

```bash
npm create qwik@latest
```

When prompted, choose a name for your project and Qwik City as your starter.
