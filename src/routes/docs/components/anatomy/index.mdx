# Component Anatomy

A component is a small, reusable piece of code that can be used to build a UI.

In Qwik, they are declared using the `component$` method:

```tsx
import { component$, useStore } from '@builder.io/qwik';

// Qwik components can be asynchronous
export const MyCmp = component$(async (props: MyCmpProps) => {
  // Declare local state
  const state = useStore({
    count: 0,
  });

  // Returns JSX
  return (
    <>
      <span>
        Hello, {props.name} {state.count}
      </span>
      <div>Times: {state.count}</div>
      <button
        onClick$={() => {
          // This will update the local state and cause a re-render.
          // Reactivity is at qwik's core!
          state.count++;
        }}
      >
        Increment
      </button>
    </>
  );
});
```

## Props

Props are used to pass data into the component. Props are declared as named arguments of the component.

In this example a component `Item` declares optional `name`, `quantity`, `description`, and `price`.

```tsx
interface ItemProps {
   name?: string,
   quantity?: number,
   description?: string,
   price?: number
}

export const Item = component$((props: ItemProps) => {
  return ...;
});
```

The resulting component can be used like so:

```tsx
const MyApp = component$(() => {
  return (
    <>
      - With no props: <Item />
      - With some props: <Item description="Item description" />
      - With all props:{' '}
      <Item name="Hammer" quantity={3} description="Best organic hammer" price={10.0} />
    </>
  );
});
```

## Lazy Loading

The host component also serves an important role when breaking parent-child relationships for bundling purposes.

```tsx
const Child = () => <span>child</span>;

const Parent = () => (
  <section>
    <Child />
  </section>
);
```

In the above example, referring to the `Parent` component implies a transitive reference to the `Child` component. When the bundler is creating a chunk, a reference to `Parent` necessitates bundling `Child` as well. (`Parent` internally refers to `Child`.) These transitive dependencies are a problem because it means that having a reference to the root component will transitively refer to the remainder of the applicationâ€”something which Qwik tries to avoid explicitly.

```tsx
const Child = component$(() => {
  return <span>child</span>;
});

const Parent = component$(() => {
  return (
    <section>
      <Child />
    </section>
  );
});
```

In the above example the Optimizer transforms the above to:

```tsx
const Child = componentQrl(qrl('./chunk-a', 'Child_onMount'));
const Parent = componentQrl(qrl('./chunk-b', 'Parent_onMount'));
const Parent_onMount = () => qrl('./chunk-c', 'Parent_onRender');
const Parent_onRender = () => (
  <section>
    <Child />
  </section>
);
```

NOTE: for simplicity, not all of the transformations are shown; all resulting symbols are kept in the same file for succinctness.

Notice that after the optimizer transforms the code, the `Parent` no longer directly references `Child`. This is important because it allows the bundler (and tree shakers) to freely move the symbols into different chunks without pulling the rest of the application with it.

So what happens when the `Parent` component renders and `Child` component has not yet been downloaded? First, the `Parent` component renders its JSX like so.

```html
<div>
  <section>
    <div></div>
  </section>
</div>
```

As you can see in the above example, the `<div/>` acts as a marker where the `Child` component will be inserted once it is lazy-loaded.

## Mental Model

The optimizer splits Qwik components into the host element and the behavior of the component. The host element gets bundled with the parent components OnRender function, whereas the component's behavior is something that gets lazy-loaded on an as-needed basis.
