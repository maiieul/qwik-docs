# Qwik City - Routing

Routing is a way to map public URLs for a site to specific components declared in your application. 

Qwik City uses directory-based routing. This means that the structure of your routes directory drives the public-facing URLs that the user will see for your application. However, it differs slightly from traditional file based routing, which we will discuss shortly.


## Directory Based Routing

Qwik City support the follwing filetypes for routes

In the Qwik City routes directory, `folders + an index` file map to a URL path. For example, if the user sees `https://example.com/some/path`, the component exported at `src/routes/some/path/index` (either `.mdx` or `.tsx`) will be shown.

```
- src/
  - routes/
    - some/
      - path/
        - index.tsx       # https://example.com/some/path
```

Note that the leaf file at the end of the route named index. This is **important**. In other meta-frameworks you may be familiar with, there is a distinction made between `pages` and `data endpoints` or `api routes`. In Qwik City, there is no distinction, they are all `endpoints`. 

To define an endpoint, you must a define an `index.[filetype]` where [filetype] can be one of:

While the following directory structure: 

```
- src/
  - routes/
    - contact.tsx
    - about.tsx
    - store.tsx
    - index.tsx
```

may work in other meta-frameworks that use file based routing, Qwik City will not register a route for any non-index files. In Qwik City, the equivalent file structure would looks like this:

```
- src/
  - routes/
    - contact/
      - index.tsx
    - about/
      - index.tsx
    - store/
      - index.tsx
    - index/
      - index.tsx
```

At first this may seem like extra work, but there are advantages to this approach. One advantage is being able define component files in a route directory without them being rendered. Consider the follwing:

```
- src/
  - routes/
    - index.tsx                 # https://example.com/
    - some/           
      - index.tsx               # https://example.com/some
      - path/
        - index.tsx             # https://example.com/some/path
        - other_component.tsx   # this file is ignored and not mapped to any URL because it is not an index.
```

The `other_component.tsx` file can be imported and used inside of `path/index.tsx`, but is otherwise ignored by Qwik City.

## Implementing a Component

To return HTML for a specific route you will need to implement a component. For `.tsx` files the component must be exported as `default`. Alternatively, you can use `.mdx` extension discussed [later](/qwikcity/content/mdx).

```typescript
export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <H1>
      Hello World!
    </H1>
  );
});
```

## `@qwik-city-plan`

Qwik City stores route information in files on disk. This is great for developer ergonomics but not useful for creating bundles and chunks. Additionally, in some environments - such as edge functions - there is no file system that can be accessed. For this reason, it is necessary to serialize the route information into a single file. This is done through the `@qwik-city-plan` import.

```typescript
import cityPlan from '@qwik-city-plan';
```

The `@qwik-city-plan` import is synthetic, meaning that it is created as part of the build step. It contains all of the information in the `/src/routes` folder in JavaScript format. The synthetic import is provided by the `qwikCity()` vite plugin available from `@builder.io/qwik-city/vite`.

## Advanced routing

Qwik City also supports:
- [Route Parameters](/qwikcity/routing/route-parameters)
- [Nested layouts](/qwikcity/layout/overview)
- [Menus](/qwikcity/content/menu)

These are discussed later.
