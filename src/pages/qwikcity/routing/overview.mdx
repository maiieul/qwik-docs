# Qwik City - Routing

Routing is a way to map public URLs for a site to specific components declared in your application. Qwik City uses a file-based router. This means that the directory/file structure drives the public-facing URLs that the user will see for your application.

## Basic routing

In the Qwik City router, folders map to paths. For example, if the user sees `https://example.com/some/path`, the component exported at `src/routes/some/path` (either `.mdx` or `.tsx`) will be shown. 

```
- src/
  - routes/
    - some/           
      - path.tsx       # https://example.com/some/path
```

## Implementing a Component

To return HTML for a specific route you will need to implement a component. For `.tsx` files the component must be exported as `default`. Alternatively, you can use `.mdx` extension discussed [later](/qwikcity/content/mdx).


```typescript
export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <H1>
      Hello World!
    </H1>
  );
});
```

### `_` prefix

Occasionally, there is a need to place files into the `src/routes` folder without them showing up on any route. In this case, use the `_` prefix to let Qwik City know that the file is private and should not be exposed.

## `@qwik-city-plan`

Qwik City stores route information in files on disk. This is great for developer ergonomics but not useful for creating bundles and chunks. Additionally, in some environments - such as edge functions - there is no file system that can be accessed. For this reason, it is necessary to serialize the route information into a single file. This is done through the `@qwik-city-plan` import.

```typescript
import cityPlan from '@qwik-city-plan';
```

The `@qwik-city-plan` import is synthetic, meaning that it is created as part of the build step. It contains all of the information in the `/src/routes` folder in JavaScript format. The synthetic import is provided by the `qwikCity()` vite plugin available from `@builder.io/qwik-city/vite`.

## Advanced routing

Qwik City also supports:
- [`index.tsx`](/qwikcity/routing/default-index)
- [Route Parameters](/qwikcity/routing/route-parameters)
- [Pathless URLs](/qwikcity/routing/pathless)
- [Nested layouts](/qwikcity/layout/overview)
- [Menus](/qwikcity/content/menu)

These are discussed later.
