# Getting Started Qwikly

Qwik is a new kind of framework that is [resumable](../concepts/resumable/index.mdx) (no JS and no hydration), built for the edge and [familiar for React developers](../cheat/qwik-react/index.mdx).

- [Stackblitz Qwik + Vite](https://qwik.new)
- [Examples playground](/examples/reactivity/counter/)

## Prerequisites

- [node.js v16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or higher
- Your favorite IDE ([vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended)
- Start to [think qwik](../think-qwik/index.mdx)

## Creating an app using the CLI

The first step is to create an application. Qwik comes with a CLI that allows you to create a basic working skeleton of an application. We will use the CLI to create a blank starter so that you can quickly familiarize yourself with it.

### Run the Qwik CLI in your shell

```shell
npm create qwik@latest
```

The CLI will guide you through an interactive menu to set the project-name and select one of the starters:

After your new app is created, you will see an output like the following in your terminal:

```shell
💫 Let's create a Qwik app 💫

✔ Project name … qwik-app
✔ Select a starter › Basic

🦄  Success!  Project created in portfolio directory

🐰 Next steps:
   cd qwik-app
   npm install
   npm start

💬 Integration? Add Netlify, Cloudflare, Tailwind...:
   npm run qwik add

💬 Questions? Start the conversation at:
   https://qwik.builder.io/chat
   https://twitter.com/QwikDev

📺 Presentations, Podcasts and Videos:
   https://qwik.builder.io/media/
```

At this point, you will have `qwik-app` directory, that contains the starter app.

## Running in development

Once the application is download.

1. Change into the directory created by the `npm create qwik`.

```shell
cd qwik-app
```

2. Invoke the dev server

```shell
npm start
```

4. You should see a server running with your To-do application

```shell

  VITE v3.1.1  ready in 140 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5174/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose

```

5. Visit http://localhost:5174/ to explore the app.

## Running in production

To run the application locally in production, run the following command:

```shell
npm run preview
```

It will build your application and the [Vite preview server](https://vitejs.dev/config/preview-options.html) to serve the application.

## Deployment

It's very easy to deploy your Qwik application to the cloud, as static files, or your own server.

Please checkout the [deployment](/qwikcity/adaptors/overview/index.mdx) section for more details.

## Other integrations

Qwik is designed to be integrated with other tools. Such as `vitest`, `tailwind`, `partytown`... run the following command to see the list of available integrations:

```shell
npm run qwik add
```

and dont forget to check the [integrations](/qwikcity/integrations/overview/index.mdx) section for more details.
