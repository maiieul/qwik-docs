# Qwik City - Default Index 
### `index.tsx` / `index.mdx`

Sometimes the route component gets too complex, and placing the whole implementation into a single file becomes impractical. In such a case, there is an alternative way to declare the same path.

```
- src/
  - routes/
    - index.tsx                 # https://example.com/
    - some/           
      - index.tsx                # https://server/some
      - path/
        - index.tsx              # https://example.com/some/path
        - _other_component.tsx   # this file is ignored and not mapped to any URL because of the leading underscore.
```

### `_` prefix

Occasionally, there is a need to place files into the `src/routes` folder without them showing up on any route. In this case, use the `_` prefix to let Qwik City know that the file is private and should not be exposed.
