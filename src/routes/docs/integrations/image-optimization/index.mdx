# Image Optimization

Image optimization is the process of reducing the number of bytes that represent an image. The smaller the image size, the faster it will load on a page. The smaller the image size, the less bandwidth it consumes. The less bandwidth it consumes, the better the experience for your users especially on mobile networks.
