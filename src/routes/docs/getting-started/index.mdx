# Getting Started Qwikly

Qwik is a new kind of framework that is [resumable](../concepts/resumable/index.mdx) (no JS and no hydration), built for the edge and [familiar for React developers](../cheat/qwik-react/index.mdx).

- [Stackblitz Qwik + Vite](https://qwik.new)
- [Examples playground](/examples/reactivity/counter/)

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js v16.8](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or higher
- Your favorite IDE ([vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended)
- Start to [think qwik](../think-qwik/index.mdx)

## Creating an app using the CLI

The first step is to create an application. Qwik comes with a CLI that allows you to create a basic working skeleton of an application. We will use the CLI to create a blank starter so that you can quickly familiarize yourself with it. Qwik supports NPM, yarn and pnpm.

### Run the Qwik CLI in your shell

Choose the package manager you prefer and run one of the following command:

```shell
npm create qwik@latest
pnpm create qwik@latest
yarn create qwik
```

The CLI will guide you through an interactive menu to set the project-name, select one of the starters and asks if you want to install the dependencies.

## Writing Qwik Components

A component is a small, reusable piece of code that can be used to build a UI.

Qwik components should look familiar to many UI developers:

```tsx
import { component$, useSignal } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const MyCmp = component$((props: MyCmpProps) => {
  // Declare local state
  const count = useSignal(0);

  // Returns JSX
  return (
    <>
      <h3>Hello, {props.name}</h3>
      <p>You have clicked {count.value} times</p>
      <button
        onClick$={() => {
          // This will update the local state and cause a re-render.
          // Reactivity is at Qwik's core!
          count.value++;
        }}
      >
        Increment
      </button>
    </>
  );
});
```
