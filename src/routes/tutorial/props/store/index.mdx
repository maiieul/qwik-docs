title: Passing Stores
---

The previous tutorial introduced you `mutable()` to demonstrate that Qwik assumes all props are static to remain efficient.

Beyond the fact that typing `mutable()` is extra work, the previous example is also inefficient in its own way.

When you click on the `+1` button, the `<App>` is re-rendered to update the `<Display>` bindings. The re-rendering of `<App>` is needed to update the props of `<Display>`, but this process doesn't update to what the user sees, so it is a waste of resources.

A better approach is to only re-render `<Display>` component by passing in the `CountStore` rather than the `count` value. Since the  store reference never changes, the `<App>` component doesn't need to re-render.

> **Your task**: Change the code to pass in `store` rather than `store.count`.

Two benefits emerge by making the above change:

- The `mutable()` binding function is removed from the component.
- The `<App>` component doesn't need to be downloaded or re-rendered.

## Best Practice

A best practice to follow in Qwik features passing a store to child components rather than individual primitives. When you use primitives, you are forced to wrap them with `mutable()` to make the application work.
